# PetSite

## Synopsis

This is a simple website that allows a user to select a few attributes and receive feedback on which of my cats they are best a match for.

The site is written in vanilla JavaScript, CSS3, HTML5 and just a little JSON for local storage.  


## Code Example

The code is pretty self explanatory and well documented with excessive comments.

## Motivation

I wrote this as a coding challenge to enter a program.  The general requirement are listed in the Synopsis.

## Tests

I haen't set up any tests for this site, but I likely will in the near future.
